🚀 Launching the Program in IntelliJ 🚀

Start the Program: Begin by running the program in IntelliJ. Once the application starts, you'll see a message in the console prompting you to type the message you want to encrypt. ✍️

Encrypt Your Message: After typing your desired message, simply press Enter, and the program will encrypt the text for you. The encrypted version will be displayed in the console, ensuring that your message is now securely encoded. 🔒

Decrypt the Message: Following the encryption process, another prompt will appear asking you to input the encrypted text you want to decrypt. This allows you to test the decryption functionality. 🔑

View the Decrypted Message: Once you type in the encrypted message and press Enter, the program will process the input and output the original message in its unaltered format, showcasing the effectiveness of the encryption-decryption cycle. ✨

Full Circle Experience: This cycle demonstrates how encryption and decryption work together, giving you a hands-on experience with secure communication. You’ll be able to see how a message is scrambled and then restored to its initial form with ease. 🔄

✅ Enjoy a seamless encryption and decryption experience, all in one simple program! This is a great way to learn about data security and cryptography, while also having fun! 🎉
